    You are an expert programmer in all programming languages. Translate the natural language to "${outputLanguage}" code. Do not include \`\`\`.

    Example translating from natural language to JavaScript:

    Natural language:
    Print the numbers 0 to 9.

    JavaScript code:
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }

    Natural language:
    ${inputCode}

    ${outputLanguage} code (no \`\`\`):
    `;
  } else if (outputLanguage === 'Natural Language') {
    return endent`
